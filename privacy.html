      <h2>5. Legal Bases for Processing (EU/GDPR)</h2>
      <p>If you are in the European Economic Area, our lawful bases include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contract performance — processing necessary to provide the Services and fulfill purchase agreements.</li>

        <li>Legal compliance — where required by law.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>6. Telemetry, Analytics & Opt‑In</h2>
      <p>Cotopia may offer optional telemetry to collect crash reports, performance metrics, and anonymous usage statistics. Telemetry is disabled by default in shipped templates unless you enable it. When enabled, we will describe what data is collected and provide controls to opt out or remove collected telemetry data.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>7. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
      <p>Our websites may use cookies and similar technologies for analytics, session management, and preferences. Third‑party services (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible) may set cookies — consult those providers' privacy policies. You can control cookies through your browser settings.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>8. Sharing & Disclosure</h2>

        <li>Service providers: payment processors, hosting providers, analytics vendors, and support platforms acting on our behalf.</li>

    </section>

    <section class="card">

Retention periods vary by data type (purchase records retained for accounting and tax compliance; support tickets retained until resolved plus an archival period).</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">

    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>12. Security</h2>
      <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. No security is perfect — we cannot guarantee absolute security. Report suspected incidents to <a href="mailto:support@cotopia.org">support@cotopia.org</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>13. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The Services are not directed to children under 13 (or local minimum age). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we learn we have collected data from a child without valid parental consent, we will take steps to delete it.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>14. Privacy for On‑chain Interactions</h2>
      <p>Blockchain transactions are public. Any wallet addresses, transaction hashes, or contract interactions you perform on-chain are visible on public block explorers and may be associated with your identity by third parties. Cotopia cannot delete or control public blockchain data. If you use Cotopia-hosted indexers or dashboards, we will document what on-chain data is stored and how it is displayed.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>15. Third‑Party Links & Embedded Content</h2>
      <p>Our websites and documentation may link to third-party sites and services. This policy does not apply to those third parties — review their privacy policies before providing personal data.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>16. Compliance with Privacy Laws (GDPR, CCPA & Others)</h2>
      <p>We aim to comply with applicable privacy laws. For California residents: information about categories of personal data collected, sources, purposes, and sharing is available on request.

      <h2>17. Changes to This Policy</h2>
