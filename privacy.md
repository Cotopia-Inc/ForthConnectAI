Privacy Policy for Forth Connect

Last updated: October 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Cotopia (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information in connection with the Forth Connect template, demo site, downloadable package, and any hosted or embedded instances of the product (collectively, the “Service”). Read this Policy carefully. If you do not agree, do not download, install, or use the Service.

1. Scope and acceptance
- This Policy applies to personal information collected through:
  - The downloadable template and any sample/demo pages included in the package.
  - Cotopia-operated websites and demo pages where the Service is hosted.
  - Any cloud-hosted or managed instances of the Service operated by Cotopia.
- By purchasing, downloading, installing, or using the Service (or visiting demo pages), you acknowledge that you have read and accept this Policy.

2. Data controller and contact
- Data controller: Cotopia (Wyoming, USA).
- Privacy / support contact: support@cotopia.org.
- For privacy inquiries, data subject requests, or to exercise your rights, contact support@cotopia.org.

3. Types of data we collect
A. Default (what the distributed template does NOT collect)
- The distributed Forth Connect template is a client-side HTML5 Canvas application. In its default packaged form it does not collect, transmit, or store personal data to Cotopia’s servers.

B. Data that may be collected on Cotopia-hosted demo sites or optional features
If you use a Cotopia-hosted demo or enable optional telemetry/features, we may collect:
- Usage analytics (anonymous or pseudonymous): page views, session duration, device/browser type, screen size, and basic interaction events.
- Diagnostic or crash reports (non-personal error data).
- Contact form data you voluntarily submit (name, email, message).
- Purchase/transaction metadata (order number, date) — payment details (card numbers) are processed by third-party payment processors and are not stored by Cotopia in raw form.

C. Data collected when you or integrators add server-side features
- If you or a third party modifies the template to add server-side multiplayer, user accounts, leaderboards, or persistence, those deployments may collect personal data (e.g., account names, emails, IP addresses). Such data collection is controlled by the deployer and not by Cotopia by default.

4. Legal bases for processing (EU/EEA)
- Where applicable, Cotopia processes personal data on these legal bases:
  - Consent: for analytics, newsletters, or marketing communications when you opt in.
  - Contract performance: to fulfill purchases, deliver downloads, or provide paid support.
  - Legitimate interests: to operate demo sites, maintain security, and improve the Service, balanced against user rights.
  - Legal obligation: to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements.

5. How we use collected data
- Operate and improve demo sites and distribution channels.
- Respond to support, sales, and feedback inquiries.
- Analyze usage to improve the Service and diagnose technical issues.
- Fulfill purchase orders and process refunds (using third-party payment processors).
- Communicate release notes, support replies, and promotional messages when you have opted in.

6. Third-party services and data sharing
- We may use third-party vendors to provide hosting, analytics, payment processing, email, and other services. These vendors process data on our behalf.
  - Hosting/CDN: e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS, GitHub Pages.
  - Analytics: e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible (subject to consent where required).
  - Payment processors: e.g., Stripe, PayPal (payment data handled by processor; Cotopia does not store raw card numbers).
  - Email providers: e.g., Mailchimp (for newsletters/support emails when you opt in).
- Cotopia does not sell personal data. Cotopia may disclose personal data to comply with legal obligations, to protect legal rights, or in connection with a merger, sale, or acquisition (with notice where required by law).

7. Cookies and similar technologies
- Cotopia-hosted demo pages may use cookies, localStorage, or similar technologies to:
  - Maintain session state for admin or support functions.
  - Store user preferences (theme, reduced motion setting).
  - Support analytics (subject to consent where required).
- You can control cookies through your browser settings. Blocking cookies may affect some demo-site features.

8. Data retention
- Analytics and logs: retained for the minimum period required for their purpose (commonly up to 26 months) unless otherwise required by law.
- Support/contact messages: retained as necessary to provide support and for recordkeeping, typically no longer than 24 months unless legal reasons require longer retention.
- Transaction records (via marketplaces/third parties): retained according to marketplace and legal/accounting obligations.

9. Security
- Cotopia implements reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
- No internet transmission or storage is completely secure. Cotopia cannot guarantee absolute security.
- In the event of a security incident requiring notification, Cotopia will follow applicable legal obligations and notify affected individuals and regulators as required.

10. Your rights and choices
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including:
- Access: request a copy of personal data Cotopia holds about you.
- Rectification: correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
- Deletion: request deletion of personal data (subject to legal exceptions).
- Restriction/Objection: ask Cotopia to limit or stop certain processing.
- Portability: receive your personal data in a common format.
- Withdraw consent: where processing is based on consent.
- Opt-out: opt out of marketing emails via unsubscribe links or by contacting support@cotopia.org.

To exercise these rights, contact support@cotopia.org. Cotopia may require identity verification and will respond within applicable legal timeframes.

11. Children
- The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the higher minimum age required by local law). Cotopia does not knowingly collect personal data from children. If Cotopia becomes aware of data collected from a child without parental consent, we will delete it.

12. International transfers
- Data processed by third-party vendors or collected on demo pages may be transferred to countries other than your own (including the United States). Cotopia implements safeguards (e.g., contractual clauses) where required to protect such transfers.

13. Integrator / downstream responsibility
- If you purchase the template and deploy it with server-side features that collect personal data, you are the data controller for that deployment and must:
  - Notify your users about data collection and handling.
  - Provide a privacy policy for your deployment.
  - Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures and respond to data subject requests.

14. Changes to this Privacy Policy
- Cotopia may update this Policy periodically. Material changes will be posted with an updated "Last updated" date. For material changes, Cotopia will provide notice via email (if you have opted in) or by posting a notice on the demo site.

15. Jurisdiction and applicable law
- This Policy is governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, United States of America. Any disputes will be subject to the applicable laws and jurisdictions in Wyoming, unless otherwise required by law.

16. Contact and privacy requests
- For privacy questions, to exercise your rights, or for general support: support@cotopia.org
- Cotopia will process requests in accordance with applicable laws and may require reasonable verification of identity.

17. Additional recommendations for customers / deployers
- If you (as a buyer/deployer) host modified or production instances that collect data, implement:
  - A clear privacy policy on your deployment site.
  - Explicit consent mechanisms for cookies and analytics where required (e.g., GDPR).
  - Secure storage and access controls for any user data.
  - Data retention and deletion policies aligned to legal requirements.

18. Miscellaneous
- This Policy is part of, and should be read alongside, any Terms & Conditions or License terms provided with the Template.
- If any provision of this Policy conflicts with mandatory local law applicable to a data subject, the mandatory local law will govern to the extent necessary.
