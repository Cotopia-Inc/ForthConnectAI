      <h1>Terms of Sale & End‑User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
      <p class="card" style="margin-top:12px"><strong>Product:</strong> Forth Connect AI — <strong>Provider:</strong> Cotopia (Wyoming, USA). <strong>Version:</strong> 1.0 — Last updated: Oct. 2025</p>
    </header>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. Introduction and Acceptance</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Sale & End‑User License Agreement ("Agreement") govern the purchase, license, download, installation, access, and use of the Forth Connect AI software, game assets, templates, example smart contracts, documentation, and related materials (collectively, the "Product") provided by Cotopia ("Cotopia", "we", "us", "our"). By purchasing, downloading, installing, or using the Product you ("Licensee", "you") agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not purchase, download, or use the Product.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Product</strong>: the files, code, documentation, smart contract examples, assets, and deliverables Cotopia provides.</li>
        <li><strong>Licensee</strong>: the individual or entity that purchases or receives the Product.</li>
        <li><strong>Edition</strong>: the license tier purchased (e.g., Lite, Pro, Enterprise) which determines permitted uses.</li>
        <li><strong>Commercial Use</strong>: using the Product in a product or service that generates revenue or is redistributed to third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>SaaS/Hosted Use</strong>: running the Product or a derivative as a hosted service for third parties.</li>

    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. License Grant</h2>
      <p>Subject to your compliance with this Agreement and payment of applicable fees, Cotopia grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable (unless expressly permitted), revocable license to use the Product as described by your purchased Edition:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lite Edition:</strong> License to use for personal, educational, or demo purposes only. No commercial deployment or resale allowed.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro Edition:</strong> License to use, modify, deploy, and incorporate into customer projects. Redistribution of the original Product source files may be restricted — you may distribute compiled/minified outputs as part of a larger work you created.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise Edition:</strong> Custom terms apply and will be included in the purchase agreement; may include sublicensing, bespoke integrations, and extended support.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unless expressly permitted by your Edition, all rights not expressly granted are reserved by Cotopia.</p>

        <li>Integrate the Product into client projects (Pro/Enterprise) provided you comply with redistribution restrictions and include required attributions.</li>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Restrictions & Prohibitions</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>Do not remove, modify, or obfuscate Cotopia’s copyright, trademark, or attribution notices included in the Product unless you hold an explicit waiver.</li>
        <li>Do not use the Product to violate laws, export controls, sanctions, or for activities that facilitate fraud, money laundering, or other illegal conduct.</li>
        <li>Do not present the Product as being developed by you (misrepresentation) — for resale or redistribution follow attribution rules in the license.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>6. Sales, Payment & Delivery</h2>
      <h3>6.1 Payment</h3>

      <h3>6.3 Failed Payment / Chargebacks</h3>
      <p>If a payment fails, is reversed, or charged back, Cotopia may suspend access, revoke license keys, and pursue collection. You remain responsible for any fees and costs of collection.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>7. License Keys, Account Access & Security</h2>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>8. Support, Maintenance & Updates</h2>

        <li><strong>Pro Support:</strong> included with Pro (e.g., 30 days of email support and bug fixes). Details provided in purchase confirmation.</li>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>9. Smart Contract, Web3 & On‑chain Components</h2>
      <p>The Product may include example smart contracts, deployment scripts, and frontend web3 integrations (the "On‑chain Components"). You acknowledge:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On‑chain Components are examples provided "as-is" for integration and education.</li>
        <li>Deploying smart contracts to public networks carries financial and security risks. Cotopia strongly recommends code review, unit tests, third‑party audit, and using multisig for owner controls before accepting real funds.</li>
        <li>Cotopia is not responsible for losses arising from deployed contracts or integration errors by Licensee or third parties.</li>
        <li>Licensee is responsible for handling token decimals, fee‑on‑transfer tokens, and token behaviors; Cotopia may document common pitfalls but does not guarantee compatibility with all tokens.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>10. Third‑Party Components & Licenses</h2>
      <p>The Product may include third‑party libraries, assets, or tools governed by separate licenses. Those component licenses take precedence for their respective parts. You must comply with third‑party license terms (e.g., Open Source licenses) included in the Product.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>11. Warranties & Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, COTOPIA PROVIDES THE PRODUCT "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. COTOPIA DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="card">
